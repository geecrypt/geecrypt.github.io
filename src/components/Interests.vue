      <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
      <p>My upcoming projects include running Minecraft on k8s, setting up a home NAS with rpi's and building a full stack website from scratch in Laravel and React. I also find cybersecurity fascinating and like to keep abreast of trends and vulnerabilities. </p>
      <p class="mb-3">When I'm not working on one of my projects, I like to get outside and clear my head. You can find me hiking, cross-country skiing, or stretching out my gangly limbs with some yoga.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">I also love travelling, and my dream would be to work as a nomadic developer - exploring the world and building the internet</p>
